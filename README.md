# Optimized 3D reconstruction of building models using GeoFlow3D

*Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for efficient and optimized reconstruction of large-scale 3D building models using GeoFlow.*

GeoFlow is a software tool that can be used to automatically reconstruct 3D building models from point clouds, with a high level of detail. It is a powerful tool for creating detailed and accurate 3D models of buildings and can be used in a variety of applications. The software is fully automated, making it easy to use and efficient for large-scale projects.

Our program is based on GeoFlow and makes use of it to perform 3D reconstruction of buildings. The process is inspired by the 3D BAG project, which is an up-to-date dataset containing detailed 3D building models of the Netherlands, based on the official BAG data and national AHN point cloud. The optimization of the reconstruction process is achieved by indexing and tiling of the input data which reduces the processing time and resources needed to generate large-scale 3D building models. The indexing and tiling of both, 3D point cloud and 2D footprints, allows for more efficient processing and handling of the 3D reconstruction workflow.
